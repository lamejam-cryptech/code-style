# Writing Good Classes
As long as we're going to be writing in a language with classes, we should
know how to write good classes.
This might seem unnecessary, but believe me I've seen some bad classes.

### What is a Class?
At its simplest, a class is just another name for a data structure.
It should contain some fields which together make up the data the class is
meant to store.

Crucially, a class should store _all_ the data it's meant to contain.
If a class contains a reference to an object that it didn't explicitly create
or copy, then it doesn't _actually_ store that data, and so that shouldn't
be a field of the class.

This is an example of two well-used class:
```c#
class MyClass1 {
    private int field1;

    private MyClass2 field2;

    public MyClass1(string path) {
        field1 = 0;
        field2 = new MyClass2(path);
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return field2.doSomething();
    }
}

class MyClass2 {
    private StreamReader field3;

    public MyClass2(string path) {
        field3 = File.OpenText(path);
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return field3.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

Contrast that against this example of a poorly-used class:
```c#
class MyClass3 {
    private int field4;

    private StreamReader field5;

    private MyClass4 field6;

    public MyClass3(string path) {
        field4 = 0;
        field5 = File.OpenText(path);
        field6 = new MyClass4(field5);
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return field6.doSomething();
    }
}

class MyClass4 {
    private StreamReader field7;

    public MyClass4(FileStream fs) {
        field7 = fs;
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return field7.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

What's wrong with the second example?
Notice that `MyClass4` stores a _reference_ to `field5`.
The class isn't actually storing the _data_ of that field; that's done in
`MyClass3`.


### So, When is a Class?
We only have a good justification for a class when there is some data that
we want to store together, and that this structure will be the
_exclusive owner_ of.
If we store a reference to data managed elsewhere, then that ownership
isn't exclusive, and that data should not be a field of the class.

So what do we do when our class needs data that it doesn't own, like in
`MyClass4`?
The answer is elegantly simple: we provide the external data explicitly
only when it's needed.
The classes `MyClass3` and `MyClass4` _should_ be written
```c#
class MyClass3 {
    private int field4;

    private StreamReader field5;

    private MyClass4 field6;

    public MyClass3(string path) {
        field4 = 0;
        field5 = File.OpenText(path);
        field6 = new MyClass4();
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return field6.doSomething();
    }
}

class MyClass4 {
    public string doSomething(StreamReader fs) {
        return fs.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

You might notice that `MyClass4` has no fields now.
That's exactly right; it's not a meaningful class anymore because it has no
data of its own.
We can completely remove the class if we want.

If we're really desperate to retain the function `MyClass4.doSomething()`,
we can rewrite it as a static function and treat `MyClass4` as its own mini
namespace:
```c#
class MyClass3 {
    private int field4;

    private StreamReader field5;

    public MyClass3(string path) {
        field4 = 0;
        field5 = File.OpenText(path);
    }

    public string doSomething() {
        return MyClass4.doSomething(field5);
    }
}

class MyClass4 {
    public static string doSomething(StreamReader fs) {
        return fs.ReadLine();
    }
}
```


### When is a Function?
As mentioned above, we sometimes have functionality that should remain separate
from the rest of the code, but has no persistent state of its own.
Truth be told, this is probably most of the code in any codebase if
sufficiently and diligently refactored.
So, when should we use a method instead of a function?

While often underappreciated, instance methods are actually a very special and
somewhat unusual thing.
An instance method only meaningfully exists when there is an explicit
association between the data stored in a class and some function we want to do
on that data.

Consider the example of a matrix class that we'd like to add arithmetic to:
```c#
class Matrix {
    public readonly int numRows;
    public readonly int numCols;

    private double[,] array;

    public Matrix(int nRows, int nCols) {
        numRows = nRows;
        numCols = nCols;

        array = new double[numRows, numCols];
    }

    public double getElement(int row, int col) {
        return array[row, col];
    }

    public void setElement(int row, int col, double val) {
        array[row, col] = val;
    }

    // ...
}
```
Should `add()` be an instance method or not?
I contend that it should _not_ be an instance method.

Addition doesn't specifically care about the data of the first term; instead,
it applies a function to the data of two terms simultaneously.
In other words, there's no explicit association between the data of a matrix
instance and addition on all matrices.

So, our matrix class should be:
```c#
class Matrix {
    // ...

    public static Matrix add(Matrix a, Matrix b) {
        Matrix c = new Matrix(a.numRows, a.numCols);

        for (int row = 0; row < a.numRows; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < a.numCols; col++) {
                double sum = a.getElement(row, col) + b.getElement(row, col);
                c.setElement(row, col, sum);
            }
        }

        return c;
    }
}
```

Notice, though, that `getElement()` and `setElement()` _are_ both instance
methods.
Both methods are inextricably tied to the current state of an instance.


## Conclusion
In summary, classes should never have fields that store references.
Anything stored in a class field should be explicitly and uniquely owned
by the class.
Any other data should be passed explicitly as parameters of any class
functions and methods.

Similarly, functions should only be instance methods when they are explicitly
tied to the data of a particular instance.
Any other functions should be actual functions.
